    #from the docs I was reading:
    #type just wants to know the name of our new class (ContactForm), what classes, if any, it should inherit from (when doing this, use django.forms.BaseForm instead of django.forms.Form; the reasons are a bit obscure and technical, but any time youâ€™re not declaring the fields directly on the class in the normal fashion you should use BaseForm) and a dictionary of attributes
    return type('ReadFileForm', (forms.BaseForm,), { 'base_fields': fields })

#this means we can dynamically adjust the number of forms created by changing the variable!
#
ReadFileForm = make_ReadFileForm(max_file_uploads)
